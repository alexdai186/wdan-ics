1.Have finished all the parts include logging files, cache, changing port,and
multiple requests.Furthermore, the POST and other methods also be implemented.

2.To change the port, just input the port number when the proxy is running.

3.The web cache is saved in the memory, it has 200 blocks,each block can hold
at most 100K data. Each block saves the request's url,time stamp and entity.
When a request is received, Hash the url to get the index of the cache and check
it. Then get the server's response.If the block's url and the time stamp are 
same to the request. Then regard it as a cache hit. Otherwise, save the request
into the cache if the entity of the response entity is no larger than 100K.

4.I use multiple threads to handle mutiple requests. When a new request is 
received. Create a new thread and detach it. I also use the rwlock to ensure the
thread secure.

5.I check the request head's attributes. Delete the 'Keep-Alive' attribute to
make sure the connection can be closed. Also, I permit the open client funciton 
and the Rio_writen function to try more than 1 time.

6.Few websites can't be visited by this proxy. Because it checks to many things,
the speed may be a little slow.
